# DMS Light — Driver Monitoring System (Light Model)

Real-time driver monitoring dashboard combining a **6-task ONNX vision model** with a **voice-based audio safety pipeline** — speaker verification, keyword detection, sentiment analysis, and multi-level alerting.

## Setup

### 1. Create virtual environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For **Jetson** (CUDA/TensorRT):
```bash
pip install onnxruntime-gpu
```

### 3. Place your model

```bash
# Copy the trained ONNX model into this directory
cp /path/to/edge_driver_model.onnx ./
```

### 4. (Optional) Enrol driver voice

```bash
python speaker_register.py
# Speak for 5 seconds — saves driver_embedding.npy
```

## Run

```bash
python app.py
```

Open **http://localhost:5000** in your browser.

## Dashboard

| Panel | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Left | Live MJPEG webcam stream with HUD overlay |
| Right sidebar | 6-task predictions with per-class probability bars |
| Gaze grid | 3×3 direction indicator — active cell highlights |
| Audio panel | Speaker ID, transcript, BERT sentiment, alert level |
| Bottom | Alert log, uptime, alert counter |

## Vision Tasks

| Task | Classes |
|------|---------|
| Drowsiness | Alert, Drowsy |
| Eye State | Open, Closed |
| Yawn | No Yawn, Yawning |
| Gaze | 8 directions (Top/Middle/Bottom × Left/Right + Top-Center/Bottom-Center) |
| Emotion | Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral |
| Activity | Safe Driving, Distracted, Phone Use, Drinking |

## Audio Pipeline

The audio pipeline runs in a background thread and fuses with vision results:

1. **Mic capture** — 16 kHz, 30 ms chunks via `sounddevice`
2. **WebRTC VAD** — voice activity detection
3. **Speech FSM** — segments speech start/end boundaries
4. **Speaker verification** — `resemblyzer` cosine similarity against enrolled driver voiceprint
5. **Whisper ASR** — `faster-whisper` (base.en, int8) transcription
6. **Keyword spotter** — matches distress phrases ("help", "sleepy", "can't drive", etc.)
7. **BERT classifier** — `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english` sentiment → risk score
8. **Risk fusion** — speaker-weighted keyword + BERT risk → alert level (NONE / CAUTION / WARNING / ALERT / CRITICAL)

## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | GET | Dashboard page |
| `/video_feed` | GET | MJPEG video stream |
| `/predictions` | GET (SSE) | Vision predictions + audio state |
| `/audio_events` | GET (SSE) | Audio alert event log |
| `/status` | GET | System health + speaker registration state |
| `/audio_status` | GET | Latest audio pipeline result |
| `/voice_results` | GET | Full voice analysis (includes speaker ID) |
| `/audio_enrol` | POST | Trigger driver voice enrollment |
| `/enrol_status` | GET | Enrollment progress (polling) |

## Demo Mode

If the ONNX model or camera is not available, the app runs in **demo mode** with animated synthetic predictions — useful for verifying the UI without hardware.

## Jetson Deployment

```bash
# GPU inference
pip install onnxruntime-gpu
```
# DMS_vision-Audio



since it able to seperate the echo (i know the user voice is not able to clear listen )  but i think our goal is achive. since our goal is to get tregier when the user voice listen than stt process suspen and wait 300ms most and than start listenig our tts .what do you think are we on right track ?# Driver-Monitoring-System-v1
